Hello, I am Sergey Oganesyan.
I created this project in three days.

Follow the instructions:
1. Download the database, the name of the database is 'online_shop'.
2. The website link is 'shop.online.com'.
3. Login to the admin page with the link 'shop.online.com/admin'.
4. Username: 'admin', password: '12345678'.

You can add a statement, edit the statement and delete the statement.

In "shop.online.com", the user will see the settings menu item in the header.

There is a line with a "login" button, after clicking on which a window will open where you can register and enter the site.

You can add an item to the site cart, change the quantity of the item and remove it from the cart.

By clicking on the "buy" button you will be redirected to the page for filling out your card form 
and by clicking on the "buy" button you will buy the product that was in your cart.

I wish you a pleasant viewing.
